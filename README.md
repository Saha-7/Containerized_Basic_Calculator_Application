  3. Docker installed on your system.
  
  ## STEP 1 :
  * Make a `Project folder` with your choice of name. My case it is named as `Calculator`.
  * Then open this folder through VS Code. Then inside this `project folder` you have to create a `src` for the application code(HTML,CSS,JS). My case it is also named as `src`.
  * Then inside this `Project folder` you have to create another file that is `dockerfile`. Your directory structure should look like this below image.
