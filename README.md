## You can also build it & run it locally. It is beginner friendly.
Prerequisities : 
  1. Docker basic knowledge must.
  2. VS Code editor.
  3. Docker installed on your system.
  
  ## STEP 1 :
  * Make a `Project folder` with your choice of name. My case it is named as `Calculator`.
  * Then open this folder through VS Code. Then inside this `project folder` you have to create a `src` for the application code(HTML,CSS,JS). My case it is also named as `src`.
  * Then inside this `Project folder` you have to create another file that is `dockerfile`. Your directory structure should look like this below image.

##STEP 2 :
* Through VS Code inside the `src` create files for HTML, CSS & JavaScript code. Copy the the code from this Repository's `src` folder.
* Similarly copy the `dockerfile` also.

##STEP 3 :
* Just like the previous image step into the `Project folder` directory. Then you have to build the image for that run this command -
```bash
  docker build -t calculator .
```
* Then to see the image is build or not run -
```bash
  docker images
```
* Then we have to run the container run -
```bash
 docker run -d -p 5000:80 Basic-Calculator calculator
```
* After that a long container id will be given to you, that means container runs successfully.
* You can also refer to the image below.
